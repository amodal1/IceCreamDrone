In this case, flying drones.","body":"## Welcome to IceCreamDrone\r\n\r\nWelcome to the IceCreamDrone project. The goal is to create, aggregate, and curate a system of parameterized behaviors for flying drones (both as individual agents and as various organized collections). We are in the process of collecting and creating a set of singular actions that can be called and combined into chunks of macro-behaviors. These macro-behaviors can then be the building blocks of various sorts of drone modes (eg. mother duck to ED209).\r\n\r\nThe project is maintained by Robert ( [@amodal1](http://github.com/amodal1) ) and Erica ( [@ericacooksey](http://github.com/ericacooksey) ) Cooksey.  Robert is very curious about the ways in which attitude is communicated by behavior in non-organic creatures lacking the face and body  behaviors expected from organic creatures. Erica thinks the drones are cute and is the much better coder.\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\nWe're just getting started. Right now, we're exploring some preliminary behaviors in Processing. Our immediate goal is to get the drone to detect and follow a face (even if moving VERY slowly). From there, we hope to improve that performance by a number of means before adding face recognition to the capabilities. We'll also add some search behavior patterns into the mix. Once we get a couple sketches together, we'll decide what language and frameworks will work best for our goals. \r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nThe [github page](https://github.com/amodal1/IceCreamDrone) is open. [Github](http://github.com) is the home for most or all of the project. We are using [github's built-in issue tracking](https://github.com/amodal1/IceCreamDrone/issues). For written documentation we'll use the [github wiki feature](https://github.com/amodal1/IceCreamDrone/wiki). We'll choose a code documentation tool once we have a better idea what will be our target language and framework.\r\n\r\n## Community\r\nThere are a lot of cool projects that have been done out there. There are a bunch more in development now. We're still new to this, so please forgive us if we are unaware of work with which we overlap or should know about. We want to share everything we do on this project and would love to hear about related projects by others in the community.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
